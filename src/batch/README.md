# Desc
Batch inference pipeline and handler script here  

# Caution
Batch **DOES NOT** reduce the inference time of one request.  
Just enable multi image pairs (person + garment) per request.


# Web Server
Maybe need a Jump Server to collect requests and combine them into a batched request.  
Or config in Kafka.
